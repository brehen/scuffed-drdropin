/**
 *  Note about isOpen prop: 
 *  
 *  Sourcing data from the staging-api is done on build-time of the Gatsby project.
 *  I noticed while writing the code that isOpen on a clinic changes from true to false
 *  when the clinic actually closes. (A real headscratcher as I was coding around that hour change!)
 *  
 *  I wanted to include this clinicIsOpen state in the UI somehow, but because I decided to 
 *  try out a source-api-plugin for gatsby, which fetches the data and inserts it into the local data
 *  storage on build time, this state would be stale pretty quickly.
 * 
 *  So isOpen is included in the GraphQL schema, but not utilized in the UI - as it was not a part of the case.
